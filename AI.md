- 2025-01-XX — FXML Refactoring: Separated view from controller using FXML pattern, created MainWindow.fxml and DialogBox.fxml for UI layout definition, updated MainWindow.java with @FXML annotations for component binding, refactored DialogBox.java to use FXMLLoader with fx:root construct, cleaned up Friday.java to use FXML loading and added getResponse() method for controller communication, achieving proper MVC separation following SE-EDU tutorial part 4.
- 2025-09-15 — Assertions Implementation: Added comprehensive assert statements throughout the codebase to document important assumptions, including null checks, preconditions, postconditions, and invariants in Parser (input validation, parsing results), TaskList (index bounds, size changes), Storage (file operations, serialization), Task hierarchy (construction, state changes), and Friday (component initialization, command processing), improving code reliability and debugging capabilities.
- 2025-09-15 — Code Quality Refactoring: Improved codebase following SE-EDU guidelines by removing debug output from Parser.parseSerializedTask, extracting common task addition response pattern in Friday.getResponse to reduce code duplication, replacing magic strings with TaskType enum constants in Parser and Storage classes, breaking down complex parseSerializedTask method into focused helper methods (createTaskByType, parseDeadlineTask, parseEventTask), and refactoring Storage.serialize method with extracted helper methods (determineTaskType, getTaskExtraData, formatSerializedTask) for better readability and maintainability.

Notes / observations

- What worked: Rapid prototyping of CLI flows, parsing patterns, and serialisation format. Generated code was immediately runnable and easy to adapt. UI refactoring improved code organization by separating concerns. Parser class centralizes all input validation and parsing logic. Storage class isolates file operations for easier testing and maintenance. Package organization improves code structure and prevents naming conflicts. GUI conversion provided interactive chat-like interface using JavaFX, with DialogBox for reusable message components. Refactoring Friday.java with helper method reduced code duplication significantly. Image integration added visual appeal with avatars, DialogBox styling improved readability with proper alignment and sizing. FXML refactoring achieved clean MVC separation with declarative UI layout, proper controller binding using @FXML annotations, and modular FXML file organization. Assert statements effectively document critical assumptions about preconditions, postconditions, and invariants without affecting normal program flow. Code quality refactoring systematically eliminated technical debt with method extraction reducing complexity, constant usage improving maintainability, and pattern extraction reducing duplication while preserving all functionality.
- What needed manual work: storage path resolution (CWD issues), small input-validation edge cases, and ensuring save() is called on every mutation. UI extraction required careful replacement of all System.out.println and Scanner usage. Parser extraction involved identifying and moving all parsing logic. Storage extraction required moving serialization and I/O logic. Package refactoring involved moving files and adding package declarations. GUI integration required converting static methods to instance methods and adapting output to DialogBox. Refactoring required systematic replacement of repeated code patterns. Image loading required resource path handling, DialogBox styling needed alignment adjustments for user vs bot messages. FXML refactoring required careful removal of hardcoded GUI setup, proper FXML file structure creation, and FXMLLoader integration with fx:root pattern. Assertions implementation required identifying key assumptions and determining appropriate assertion placement without disrupting program logic. Code quality improvements needed systematic identification of quality issues, careful method extraction while preserving functionality, and fixing test files that referenced outdated method names.
- Time saved: Estimated 2–4 hours across tasks that would otherwise be boilerplate and refactor work. UI refactoring streamlined future maintenance. Parser class makes the code more testable and maintainable. Storage class enables easier mocking for unit tests. Package organization makes the codebase more professional and scalable. GUI implementation provided a modern interface without rewriting core logic. Refactoring saved time by eliminating repetitive code and improving readability. Image and styling enhancements added polish without major rewrites. FXML refactoring provided better maintainability, separation of concerns, and easier UI modifications without code changes. Assertions provide instant feedback during development and testing, catching assumption violations early. Code quality refactoring improved long-term maintainability by making methods shorter and more focused, eliminating technical debt, and establishing patterns for future development.
- Recommendation: Review generated code for edge cases, add unit tests for load/save and parsing, and consider extracting Storage responsibilities into a dedicated class. UI class provides good foundation for future enhancements like colored output or GUI. Parser class enables easier testing of parsing logic and better error handling. Storage class improves modularity and testability of persistence layer. Package structure should be maintained and expanded as the project grows. GUI can be extended with images for DialogBox and better styling. Test GUI on different platforms, consider adding more visual feedback like animations or themes. FXML architecture enables easier UI changes and designer collaboration, consider using Scene Builder for future UI modifications. Assertions should be used consistently throughout the codebase, especially in public methods and critical operations, and can be disabled in production if needed for performance. Continue applying code quality practices by regularly reviewing methods for complexity, maintaining consistent naming conventions, and extracting common patterns to prevent future technical debt accumulation.
